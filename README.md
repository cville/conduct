## Inclusion

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

* You belong. So does the person next to you. Exercise consideration and
  respect in your speech and actions.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Acknowledge that a code of conduct is a tool to manage inclusive events
  (seemingly harmless comments can be perceived very differently by others).
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert
  community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress,
  or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
* Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the
  public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.
