# Charlottesville Community Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

We are dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, and accessible experience for _everyone_. Simply by joining the community, you belong in it. So does the person next to you.

This code exists so that everyone can understand what is necessary in order to provide that experience. We expect everyone to behave without misconduct so that each participant is welcome and empowered to fully contribute to a community which demonstrates respect and behaves without prejudice, discrimination, or threat. This code of conduct is about behavior _in context_. Behavior which is acceptable in some settings may not be appropriate in the context of the full community.

Specific forms of misconduct are named within the table of contents. Other sections in this document indicate how to interpret conduct and implement the code.

## Scope & Purpose

This code of conduct covers participation with any community group or event, in person or through any media, for which the respective organizer has posted a link to, or otherwise announced, this code of conduct. By adopting this code of conduct, they are saying that they are dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, and accessible experience for _everyone_.

Your everyday rights are respected. This document names conduct and misconduct with the goal to maintain a safe, inclusive, and accessible community. Participation in the community, therefore, asks that you adhere to this code. You have a right to free speech, for instance, but other participants in _this community_ will not tolerate that speech when it goes against the code of conduct. You may find some behavior appropriate in one setting which is deemed inappropriate in the context of the full community.

The community is a resource to everyone, and as a resource, is more valuable as it has contribution from more diverse perspectives. Proper conduct provides respectful space for everyone to feel welcome and to contribute.


## Disclaimer

Community members have authored this code of conduct. This is not a legal guide, nor does it provide emergency services. Seek professional assistance for all serious issues. Escalate health and safety issues to emergency services.


## What to Do

### Every Day

* Exercise consideration and respect in your writing, speech, and actions. You belong. So does the person next to you.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Acknowledge that a code of conduct is a tool to manage inclusive events; seemingly harmless comments can be perceived very differently by others.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community organizers if you notice a health/safety issue, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
* Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.


### When you are affected by misconduct

**In a health/safety or similar emergency, dial 911.**

1. **Prioritize your own well-being** over what the community might need. We are committed to providing you support, and you can seek that support in a manner which matches your preferences or needs. We are here to provide a safe, inclusive, and accessible experience for you to continue participating in the community.
2. **As you are able, disengage** from the misconduct.
3. **Contact an organizer.** You have a right to be respected. You are _not_ being "oversensitive" or a burden by speaking up.
4. **Allow an organizer or designated party to talk with the person** regarding the code of conduct. As you see fit, provide your preferences to the organizer on how to resolve the situation, in a private setting.
5. After the misconduct has been addressed, the organizer will **confirm that the air is clear** and that you once again feel welcome to continue participating in the community. Feel free to reach out to the organizer before they reach back out to you.


### When you witness misconduct

**In a health/safety or similar emergency, dial 911.**

Contact an organizer when you notice a health/safety issue, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

Note that, for the purpose of the code of conduct, "an organizer" is anyone who regularly organizes groups/events with this code of conduct. This applies even when that organizer is not organizing _this_ group/event, with priority given to the organizers who are.


### When an organizer talks with you about this code of conduct

When an organizer talks with you in response to something that you were doing, in the context of this code of conduct:

1. Above all, **stop** whatever you were doing.
2. As much as possible, **listen** to the feedback provided. This code of conduct has years of history behind it, and most of the time, an organizer will have put significant thought into the situation at hand before contacting you.
3. Note that for many topics of conduct, the goal is to **create space for others**. You might be contacted about things which are "harmless" or had "good intentions." Very often, the response to the conduct in question is, "others perceive this very differently than you." In those cases, it's not that you are a "problem" but that the community is committed to being inclusive and there's feedback on how to do that. Even if you are not sure how to take it in, it helps to appreciate this context.
4. If you would like, speak with the organizer to **clarify your intent**, ideally in a private setting. You deserve respect, too. Avoid trying to change minds or explain "how it works"; these are counterproductive.
5. **Clear the air.** Find consensus with the organizer on how to signal to others that the issue is resolved.

Notes:

* It might not feel like it, but be open to the possibility that an organizer wants your continued participation. The code of conduct is here to clarify how to continue participation after an issue occurs. Seek to repair the situation with others, and in doing so, you will find respect for taking ownership of the issue.
* If discussions are heated, take a few hours or a few days as appropriate to let things cool before taking each of these steps.
* For serious issues, especially those which compromise others' health and safety, you might be asked to stop participating in the community. Discuss with the organizer how to reinstate your participation, and give some time for a considerate response.
* Repeat issues or patterns of misconduct are taken more seriously than an isolated issue.


## Misconduct

### Compromising health & safety

Any conduct which compromises health & safety of any other person, or otherwise increases such risks, will be escalated to emergency services.


### Violating personal space

Misconduct includes deliberate intimidation, unwelcome physical closeness, inappropriate physical contact, stalking, following, unwelcome photography or recording, and unwelcome attention.


### Violating digital security

Misconduct includes any behavior which compromises a computer's security, availability of services, personal online privacy, or privacy and security of digital documents. Misconduct further includes encouraging others to participate in an activity which knowingly increases risk of digital privacy and security issues.


### Reinforcing social structures of domination

Misconduct includes any comment which reinforces social structures of domination, as they relate to color, ancestry, national origin, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital or family status, physical appearance, physical or mental disability, medical condition, veteran status, actual or presumed belonging to an ethnic group, education, occupation, income, or socioeconomic status.


### Targeting minority groups

Misconduct includes solicitation of input to find someone in the community to speak to the whole of a demographic or other status based on how that individual personally identifies.

Note that comments targeting groups in a position of minority, particularly when the individual commenting does not identify as belonging to that position, is potentially left open to perception that such a comment reinforces social structures of domination.


### References to sexual or other NSFW topics

Misconduct includes sexual references or images and other topics generally considered not suitable for work (NSFW).


### Repeating invitations

Misconduct includes repeat invitations to _anything_ when a person has directly declined or opted not to reply to an invitation.

These are acceptable:

* Posting an invitation on a regular basis to a regularly occurring event.
* Posting reminders of an upcoming event as the date draws near.

These invitations might be guided by organizers to specific channels or media by which the community generally prefers to receive such invitations.

These are _not_ acceptable:

* Not taking "no" (or no answer, which here defaults to "no") for an answer, for anything.
* Inviting others to a personal party, unless they've opted in to receiving such invitations.


### Discussing national politics in public

Unless a group or event identifies as political in nature, misconduct includes discussion or views of national politics in public areas of the community. Specific channels or media may be identified as preferring political discussion, for which such discussion is acceptable. It is acceptable to advocate for creating areas in the community in which political discussions are appropriate.


### Disrupting talks, discussion threads, or other events.

Misconduct includes sustained disruption of a talk, discussion thread, or other event.


## When you organize an event

### Up front

* Clearly identify yourself as the organizer, with contact information, so that participants know how to reach you.
* Become familiar with the code of conduct. Reach out to other organizers to discuss topics and find support in implementing the code of conduct.
* Identify/deputize assistants, confirmed participants who are trusted, who can become familiar with the code of conduct and be prepared to join in taking action as needed.
* Plan how you will respond to misconduct and emergencies.


### When there is a health/safety issue

**In a health/safety or similar emergency, dial 911.**

Prioritize health and safety of participants, above all else. With health/safety issues, follow protocol as directed by emergency service officials. In assault-related cases, as possible and appropriate, advocate for respectful space for the victim. Having to deal with the issue in the open further adds burden to the terrible experience. Seek and support preferences of the victim, and offer to coordinate having other participants of trust walk with the individual, as appropriate and welcomed.


### When addressing misconduct

1. Seek counsel with other organizers. Operate on consensus. Recuse yourself if you are affected by misconduct.
2. Review again the "what to do" sections which speak to the parties involved. Incorporate these steps into your forthcoming plan.
3. With fellow organizers, discuss a plan to resolve the issue of misconduct. Document details to support the plan.
4. Carry out that plan.
5. Follow up to ensure that the air is clear for the person affected, the person with whom you provided feedback on the code of conduct, and for the community.


### When you need to ask someone to leave the community

Following the previous section, find consensus with other organizers to remove a participant from the community, when a person:

* compromises others' health and safety
* has repeat issues or patterns of misconduct
* engages in unconscionable behavior
* is identified to be a participant in a hate group
* exhibits _any reason_ that causes organizers serious concern


### When misconduct is public

1. Be a public presence of good conduct.
2. Speak openly in public that something is cause for concern in the code of conduct, _but_ ...
3. Act in a manner which is respectful of alternative narratives.
4. Take comments to a private setting as early as possible, which may mean _before_ addressing the concern publicly.
5. Work collaboratively and prioritize clearing the air for everyone.

Notes:

* By supporting alternative narratives, shame no one for making a mistake.
* Address malice swiftly and with force.
* Unpack issues privately where possible.
* Speak publicly to make clear to others that the conduct is indeed _misconduct_ or is otherwise being evaluated as such.


## Accessibility

If you have a preference or need to support full participation as it relates to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), or similar request, simply contact an organizer in advance. Events are sometimes hosted informally at an office or other venue which may not be fully equipped. With some lead time on a request, an organizer can seek to relocate an event to a venue which is appropriately laid out and equipped.


## About this Code of Conduct

### Why?

You are welcome to ask, respectfully. Note that others will specifically seek out a code of conduct when choosing to participate, and of course, any feedback on the code of conduct is subject to the code of conduct itself.

Why? The rules allow everyone space and respect.


### Why is it so long?

The code of conduct names expectations on each member of the community, naming specific behaviors which are acceptable or not. To accomplish this, the code of conduct needs to provide a balance between:

* A short version, which (a) is a quick read, and (b) has enough detail to understand the long version.
* A long version, which makes very clear how to implement the code of conduct and respond to specific scenarios.


### What about ...?

The code of conduct is open source, and you are welcome to contact one of the authors directly (contact information is on GitHub profile pages), open an issue, or send a pull request.
